# Shadow-Detection-Algorithm-for-Aerial-and-Satellite-Images
Python implementation of shadow detection and correction algorithm proposed in academia

This repository contains functions to detect shadow - covered areas in aerial/satellite imagery and to correct for the brightness of 
the image in the shadow - covered areas as proposed in the paper ''Near Real - Time Shadow Detection and Removal in Aerial Motion 
Imagery Application' by Silva G.F., Carneiro G.B., Doth R., Amaral L.A., de Azevedo D.F.G. (2017).
